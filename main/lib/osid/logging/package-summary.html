 * 
 * <p>Defines the interfaces necessary to describe the logging
 * service.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The Logging OSID provides a means to read and wite to logs. A Log 
 * represents a collection of log entries. Each log entry is composed of a 
 * priority <code> Type, </code> timestamp, <code> Agent, </code> and typed 
 * content. </p> 
 * 
 * <p> Logs can be organized into hierarchies for federation. A log that is a 
 * parent of another log makes visible the log entries of its children. </p> 
 * 
 * <p> Example: 
 * <pre>
 *      
 *      
 *      LoggingSession out = manager.getLoggingSession();
 *      out.log(warningLogEntryPriorityType, "hello world", stringLogEntryContentType);
 *      
 *      LogReadingSession in = manager.getLogReadingSession();
 *      LogEntryList entries = inn.getLogEntries();
 *      while (entries.hasNext()) {
 *          LogEntry entry = entries.getNextLogEntry();
 *          if (entry.implementsContentType(stringLogEntryType)) {
 *              print (entry.getContent(stringLogEntryType));
 *          }
 *      }
 *          
 *      
 *
