 * 
 * <p>Defines the interfaces necessary to describe the repository
 * service.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The Repository OSID provides the service of finding and managing digital 
 * assets. There are many facets to this service. An <code> Asset </code> 
 * represents a unit of content, whether it be an image, a video, an 
 * application document or some text. The Asset defines a core set of 
 * definitions applicable to digital content, such as copyright and publisher, 
 * and allows for a type specification to be appended as with other <code> 
 * OsidObjects. </code> </p> 
 * 
 * <p> Asset content, such as a document, is defined such that there may be 
 * multiple formats contained with the same asset. A document may be 
 * accessible in both PDF and MS Word, but is the same document, for example. 
 * An image may have both a large size and a thumbnail version. Generally, an 
 * asset contains more than one version of content when it is left to the 
 * application to decide which is most appropriate. </p> 
 * 
 * <p> The <code> Asset </code> <code> Type </code> may define methods in 
 * common throughout the content variations. An example asset is one whose 
 * content <code> Types </code> are "Quicktime" and "MPEG", but the <code> 
 * Asset </code> <code> Type </code> is "movie" and defines methods that 
 * describe the move aside from the formats. This "double" Type hierarchy 
 * stemming from the asset requires more care in defining interfaces. <code> 
 * Assets </code> also have "credits" which define the authors, editors, 
 * creators, performers, producers or any other "role", identified with a role 
 * <code> Type, </code> with the production of the asset. These are managed 
 * externally to the asset through another <code> OsidSession. </code> </p> 
 * 
 * <p> Through additional optional <code> OsidSessions, </code> the <code> 
 * Asset </code> can be "extended" to offer temporal information. An asset may 
 * pertain to a date, a period of time, or a series of dates and periods. This 
 * mechanism is to offer the ability to search for assets pertaining to a 
 * desired date range without requiring understanding of a <code> Type. 
 * </code> Similarly, the Asset can also map to spatial information. A 
 * photograph may be "geotagged" with the GPS coordinates where it was taken, 
 * a conical shape in stellar coordinates could be described for an 
 * astronimocal image, or there may be a desire to may a historical book to 
 * the spatial coordinates of Boston and Philadelphia. Unlike temporal 
 * mappings, the definition of the spatial coordinate is left to a spatial 
 * Type to define. The Repository OSID simply manages spatial mappings to the 
 * Asset. <code> Assets </code> may also relate to <code> Subjects. </code> 
 * The <code> Subject </code> provides the ability to normalize information 
 * related to subject matter across the <code> Assets </code> to simplify 
 * management and provide a more robust searching mechanism. For example, with 
 * a photograph of the Empire State Building, one may wish to describe that it 
 * was designed by Shreve, Lamb and Harmon and completed in 1931. The 
 * information about the building itself can be described using a <code> 
 * Subject </code> and related to the photograph, and any other photograph 
 * that captures the building. The <code> Asset </code> <code> Type </code> 
 * for the photograph may simply be "photograph" and doesn't attempt to 
 * describe a building, while the <code> AssetContent </code> <code> Type 
 * </code> is "image/jpeg". </p> 
 * 
 * <p> An application performing a search for Empire State Building can be 
 * execute the search over the <code> Subjects, </code> and once the user has 
 * narrowed the subject area, then the related Assets can be retrieved, and 
 * from there negotiate the content. A provider wishing to construct a simple 
 * inventory database of buildings in New York may decide to do so using the 
 * Resource OSID. The <code> Resource </code> <code> Type </code> may describe 
 * the construction dates, height, location, style and architects of 
 * buildings. The <code> Type </code> may also include a means of getting a 
 * reference image using the <code> Asset </code> interface. Since there is no 
 * explicit relationship between <code> Subject </code> and <code> Resource, 
 * </code> the <code> Resource </code> can be adapted to the <code> Subject 
 * </code> interface (mapping a <code> buildingResourceType </code> to a 
 * <code> buildingSubjectType </code> ) to use the same data for <code> 
 * Subject </code> to <code> Asset </code> mappings and searching. Asset 
 * compositions can be created using the <code> Composition </code> interface. 
 * A <code> Composition </code> is a group of <code> Assets </code> and 
 * compositions may be structured into a hierarchy for the purpose of 
 * "building" larger content. A content management system may make use of this 
 * interface to construct a web page. The <code> Composition </code> hierarchy 
 * may map into an XHTML structure and each <code> Asset </code> represent an 
 * image or a link in the document. However, the produced web page at a given 
 * URL may be represented by another single <code> Asset </code> that whose 
 * content has both the URL and the XHTML stream. </p> 
 * 
 * <p> Another example is an IMS Common Cartridge. The <code> Composition 
 * </code> may be used to produce the zip file cartridge, but consumers may 
 * access the zip file via an <code> Asset </code> . </p> 
 * 
 * <p> <code> Compositions </code> also relate to <code> Subjects. </code> 
 * Finally, <code> Assets, </code> <code> Subjects, </code> and <code> 
 * Compositions </code> may be categorized into <code> Repository </code> 
 * objects. A <code> Repository </code> is a catalog-like interface to help 
 * organize assets and subject matter. Repositories may be organized into 
 * hierarchies for organization or federation purposes. </p> 
 * 
 * <p> This number of service aspects to this Repository OSID produce a large 
 * number of definitions. It is recommended to use the <code> 
 * RepositoryManager </code> definition to select a single <code> OsidSession 
 * </code> of interest, and work that definition through its dependencies 
 * before tackling another aspect. </p>
