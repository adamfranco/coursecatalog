/**
 * <center><strong>transaction 3.0.0</strong></center>
 * 
 * <p>Defines the interfaces necessary to describe the transaction
 * service.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The transaction OSID provides the means in which multiple OSID sessions 
 * can be coordinated. An <code> OsidSession </code> supports transactions by 
 * supporting the <code> Transaction </code> interface. The <code> 
 * TransactionSession </code> is the way multiple <code> Transaction </code> 
 * objects can be managed. </p> 
 * 
 * <p> An ideal transaction is one that supports Atomicity, Consistency, 
 * Isolation and Durability (ACID). This is difficult to achieve and 
 * impossible without the cooperation of the underlying system. The 
 * transaction interface, however, is a useful vehicle for supporting multiple 
 * operations or a sequence of operations. Since the ACID characteristics of a 
 * transaction, like all issues of data persistence, are in the purvue of the 
 * provider, they are not addressed in the interface definition leaving a 
 * given provider to determine the nature of the transactions it wants to 
 * support.

 *      
 *      
 *      Transaction agentTransaction = agentAdminSession.createTransaction();
 *      Transaction msgTransaction = messagingSession.createTransaction();
 *      
 *      TransactionSession transactions = manager.createSession();
 *      transactions.add(agentTransaction);
 *      transactions.add(msgTransaction);
 *      
 *      agentAdminSession.updateAgent(agentId, agentForm);
 *      messagingSession.send(agentId, "I changed your name.");
 *      
 *      transactions.commit();
 *      
 *
