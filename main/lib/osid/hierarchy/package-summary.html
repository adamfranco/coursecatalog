 * <p>The Hierarchy OSID provides a means for accessing and managing 
 * hierarchucal relationships among OSID Ids. An OSID Id may have onr or more 
 * parents or children and the hierarchy itself represents a directed acyclic 
 * graph. The hierarchy service defines a set of interfaces used among other 
 * OSIDs that utilize hierarchies and can also be used to abstract a 
 * hierarchical data into a standalone service. </p>
