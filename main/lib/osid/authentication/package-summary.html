/**
 * <center><strong>authentication 3.0.0</strong></center>
 * 
 * <p>Defines the interfaces necessary to describe the authentication
 * service.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The Authentication OSID helps a consumer acquire and validate 
 * authentication credentials without having to manage the details of a 
 * particular authentication environment. Authentication is generally a two 
 * step process. A user wishing to authenticate acquires a set of credentials 
 * and transports those credentials to a remote peer. The remote peer then 
 * validates those credentials and determines the identity of the user 
 * represented. This process is reflected in the Authentication OSID with the 
 * definition of two OSID sessions: </p> 
 * 
 * <p> 
 * <ul>
 *     <li> <code> AuthenticationAcquisitionSession: </code> session to 
 *     acquire credentials from a user and serialize them for transport to a 
 *     remote peer for authentication </li> 
 *     <li> <code> AuthenticationValidationSession: </code> session to receive 
 *     and validate authentication credentials from a remote peer wishing to 
 *     authenticate </li> 
 * </ul>
 * The transport of authentication credentials is the responsibility of the 
 * consumer of the Authentication OSID as authentication generally supports an 
 * existing application protocol enviornment. A means exists to extract and 
 * supply credentials at each end. An Authentication provider may support 
 * either or both sessions, and one or more credential formats. Methods also 
 * exist to support a challenge-response type system. The Authentication OSID 
 * defines an <code> Agent </code> to represent the identity of the 
 * authenticated entity. An Agent may map to a specific authentication 
 * principal or some providers may hide multiple authentication principals 
 * behind a single <code> Agent </code> identity. Because principal identities 
 * tend not to be durable and persistent, consumers should always persist the 
 * <code> Id. </code> Relationships to other OSIDs such as Resource are made 
 * using the <code> Id </code> as the key. The Authentication service links to 
 * an Authorization service via the <code> Agent Id. </code> An Authorization 
 * service describes what actions the <code> Agent </code> is authorized to 
 * perform. An <code> Agent </code> may map to a <code> Resource. M </code> 
 * ultiple <code> Agents </code> may map to a single <code> Resource </code> 
 * for the purpose of defining distinct security levels of assurance (although 
 * the paranoid may opt for defining a pseudo-resource for each <code> Agent 
 * </code> ). These security levels of assurance can be identified through the 
 * <code> Agent </code> <code> Type </code> for the purposes of mapping a 
 * <code> Resource </code> back to one or more approporiate <code> Agents 
 * </code> to facilitate authorization maintenance. The <code> Agent </code> 
 * <code> Type </code> is an indicator of the strength of the authentication 
 * and although it may correlate to a specific authentication technology, 
 * coupling it too tightly to a particular technology may limit flexibility. 
 * </p> 
 * 
 * <p> The Authentication OSID can also manage <code> Agents </code> and 
 * associated keys. Key management sessions are defined to extract, modify and 
 * delete keys. </p> 
 * 
 * <p> Example client side authentication: 
 * <pre>
 *      
 *      
 *      if (manager.supportsAuthenticationAcquisition() &&
 *          manager.supportsAcquisition_nputType(krb5ServiceType) &&
 *          manager.supportsCredentialType(serialKRB5Type)) {
 *          AuthenticationAcquisitionSession aas = manager.getAuthenticationAcquisitionSession();
 *      
 *          // specify input parameters (interface extension)
 *          KRB5Service kService = new KRB5Service();
 *          kService.setName("host");
 *          kService.setInstance("server.osid.org");
 *          kService.setRealm("OSID.ORG");
 *      
 *          // get Credential (interface type) 
 *          Authentication auth = aas.getAuthentication(kService, krb5ServiceType);
 *          SerializedKRB5Ticket ticket = (SerializedKRB5Ticket)        auth.getCredential(serialKRB5Type);
 *          send_data_to_peer(ticket); // app specific protocol
 *      }
 *      
 *              
 *      
 * </pre>
 * </p> 
 * 
 * <p> Example server side authentication: 
 * <pre>
 *      
 *      
 *      if (manager.supportsAuthenticationValidation() &&
 *          manager.supportsCredentialType(serialSAML2Type)) {
 *          AuthenticationValidationSession avs = manager.getAuthenticationValidationSession();
 *      
 *          Authentication auth = authenticate(SAML2Token, serialSAML2Type);
 *      
 *          if (auth.isValid()) {
 *              Agent agent = auth.getAgent(); // identity established
 *          }
 *      }
 *      
 *              
 *      
 * </pre>
 * Certain consumers may wish to be notified of changes within the service. 
 * Authentication supports notifications via an <code> 
 * AgentNotificationSession. </code> </p> 
 * 
 * <p> 
 * <pre>
 *      
 *      
 *      if (manager.supportsAgentNotification()) {
 *          AgentNotificationSession ans = manager.getAgentNotificationSession(receiver);
 *          ans.registerForNewAgents();
 *          hangAround();
 *      }
 *      
 *      AgentReceiver receiver {
 *          newAgent(Id agentId) { print("new agent"); }
 *          changedAgent(Id agentId) { print("updated agent"); }
 *          deletedAgent(Id agentId) { print("deleted agent"); }
 *      }
 *      
 *              
 *
