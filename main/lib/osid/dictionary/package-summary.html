/**
 * <center><strong>dictionary 3.0.0</strong></center>
 * 
 * <p>Defines the interfaces necessary to describe the dictionary
 * service.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The Dictionary OSID manages key/value pairs. A key and a value may be of 
 * an arbitrary type. Dictionaries may be used to support a Locale or 
 * Configuration OSID, or may be used to provide any translation or 
 * conversion. The Dictionary OSID is a powerful tool for abstracting and 
 * simplifying applications and other OSID implementations. </p> 
 * 
 * <p> The Dictionary OSID supports federation or multiple dictionaries 
 * through the <code> Dictionary </code> interface. Each <code> Dictionary 
 * </code> object is characterized by a display name, description, a set of 
 * properties, and may contain zero or more <code> Entry </code> objects. Each 
 * entry identifes a key/value pair. Dictionary objects may be structured in 
 * the form of a hierarchy to categorize a set of dictionaries or for he 
 * purpose of inheritance. BasicExample: 
 * <pre>
 *      
 *      
 *      EntryLookupSession lookupSession = mgr.getEntryLookupSession();
 *      string definition = (string) lookupSession.getEntry("gambrel", strType, strType);
 *      
 *              
 *      
 * </pre>
 * FederatedExample: 
 * <pre>
 *      
 *      
 *      DictionaryLookupSession dictLookupSession = mgr.getDictionaryLookupSession();
 *      Dictionary dict = dictLookupSession.getDictionary(dict_id);
 *      EntryLookupSession lookupSession = mgr.getEntryLookupSessionForDictionary(dict);
 *      JpegImage jpg = lookupSession.getEntry(tiffImage, tiffType, jpegType);
 *      
 *              
 *
