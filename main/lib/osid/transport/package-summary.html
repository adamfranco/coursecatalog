 * 
 * <p>Defines the interfaces necessary to describe the transport
 * service.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The transport OSID provides a simple means of moving serialized data to 
 * or from the local endpoint. It defines to stream-like inerfaces, the <code> 
 * DataInputStream </code> and the <code> DataOutputStream </code> for reading 
 * and writing data. </p> 
 * 
 * <p> The transport OSID defines an inbound and an outbound service. An 
 * outbound transport service is used from a local endpoint to a single remote 
 * endpoint. The remote endpoint may represent one or more physical endpoints, 
 * such as a multicast network, but presents itself as a single enpoint to the 
 * consumer. The inbound service is used to receive and process data from 
 * multiple remote endpoints and is implemented using a callback mechanism 
 * when a new request for association arrives. An association or connection 
 * between two endpoints is represented by the <code> TransportSession. 
 * </code> Data may be written or read where each read or write is handled by 
 * a data stream. Ths transport OSID does not describe the format or sequence 
 * of the data which must be agreed upon at both ends. The OSID simply acts as 
 * a cover for specific transport or session related APIs, and provides a 
 * means for modular handling of service location for the purpose 
 * implemengting a redundancy or load balancing scheme. Structures and 
 * object-oriented data and presented through other OSIDs where applicable. 
 * The transport OSID may be used within another OSID to handle the transport 
 * of serialized data that may correspond to a higher level OSID object. </p> 
 * 
 * <p> The transport OSID can be used as the glue between an authentication 
 * OSID and the over-the-wire protocol that will be used to transport or 
 * receive a serialized authentication credential. A TransportSession may be 
 * instantiated by passing an authentication credential and conversely the 
 * authentication credential can be supplied to the transport receiver. The 
 * data streams defined in the transport OSID are also used in other OSIDs 
 * where a data stream is required such as the filing OSID or an Asset that 
 * contains arbitrary serialized data. Outbound example: 
 * <pre>
 *      
 *      
 *      TransportSession session = manager.getOutboundSession();
 *      DataOutputStream out = session.sendData();
 *      String cmd = "<call><command>get_songs</command><params><param>" + album + "</param></params></call>";
 *      out.write(cmd.length(), cmd);
 *      out.close();
 *      
 *      while(session.hasDataAvailable()) {
 *          DataInputStream in = session.receiveData();
 *          add_song_to_play_queue(in);
 *      }
 *      
 *              
 *      
 * </pre>
 * Inbound Example: 
 * <pre>
 *      
 *      
 *      public void dispatch(TransportSession session, Authentication auth) {
 *          if (authzSession.isAuthorized(auth.getAgentId, fId, qId)) {
 *              String argv = parse_command_from_stream(session.receiverData());
 *              if (argv[0].equals("get_songs")) {
 *                  Song songs = get_songs_from_album(argv[1]);
 *                  for (song: songs) {
 *                      DataOutputStream out = session.sendData();
 *                      out.write(song.data(), song.size());
 *                  }
 *              }
 *          }
 *      }
 *
