 * <center><strong>cataloging 3.0.0</strong></center>
 * 
 * <p>Defines the interfaces necessary to describe the cataloging
 * service.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The Cataloging OSID provides a means for organizing objects into 
 * catalogs. An object is represented by an OSID Id. Catalogs can be used for 
 * <code> OsidObjects </code> using their Ids or consumer objects whose 
 * identifiers are exprsssed via an Id. </p> 
 * 
 * <p> Catalogs can be organized into hierarchies for federation. A catalog 
 * that is a parent of another catalog includes the Ids of its children. </p> 
 * 
 * <p> The Cataloging OSID provides the core definition for the catalogging 
 * functions used throughout the OSIDs and aids in the adaptability of 
 * cataloging structures. </p>
