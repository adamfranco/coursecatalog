 * 
 * <p>Defines the interfaces necessary to describe the filing
 * service.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The Filing OSID provides a means for managing and accessing files and 
 * directories. The Filing OSID is used to abstract assumptions made about 
 * using a specific file system, or can be used to provide a file-based 
 * application a file system oriented view of other OSIDs. </p> 
 * 
 * <p> The Filing OSID defines a file access session that maps to a single 
 * file. This is the simplest application of the Filing OSID can be used in 
 * circumstances when it is desirable to confine knowledge of a particular 
 * path within a provider. In visible federation, the consumer may select a 
 * file based on a given path name. </p> 
 * 
 * <p> Unlike the other OSIDs, the identity of a file is based on a path 
 * string rather than an <code> Id. </code> The path name serves as a unique 
 * identifier. Files also have a name which is used as an identifier with 
 * respect to a specific directory. Generally, the name is the last component 
 * of the path but the OSIDs don't specify a particular relationship between 
 * the file name and its absolute path. The Filing OSID differs from common 
 * file system APIs in its separate treatment of files and directories. An 
 * application may access a single file, or query for all files and 
 * subdirectories within a given directory. Directory browsing is performed 
 * through the <code> DirectoryEntryLookupSession. </code> To browse a 
 * different directory, a new loookup ses_ion is spawned. </p> 
 * 
 * <p> <code> Files </code> and <code> Directories </code> are not OSID 
 * Objects although some of their characteristics are inherited from the 
 * general OSID Object pattern. The Filing OSID site somewhere between a 
 * generic transport or persistence service and a more structured OSID object. 
 * As such, <code> Files </code> and <code> Directories </code> also do not 
 * have extensible interfaces or <code> Types. </code> Corresponding metadata 
 * can be handled in sidecar files and incorporated into a higher level 
 * interface such as <code> Asset. </code> <code> Files </code> and <code> 
 * Directories </code> may support searches and notifications in a similar 
 * pattern to the higher level OSIDs. However, the hierarchy in the Filing 
 * service is implicit involving a navigation of parent/child relationships 
 * from within the <code> Directory. </code> The hierarchy is also restricted 
 * to having single parents under a single root. </p> 
 * 
 * <p> Sessions are organized into operations on a single file, operations 
 * within a single directory, and operations across directories. Since 
 * provider boundaries will generally correspond to directory nodes, it is 
 * desirable to contain authentication and state management within a single 
 * session for most common operations. </p> 
 * 
 * <p> The naming of the parameters include: </p> 
 * 
 * <p> 
 * <ul>
 *     <li> name: name of a file or directory without the path component </li> 
 *     <li> path: absolute or relative path of the filr or directory including 
 *     the name component </li> 
 *     <li> absolute path: absolute path from the root including the name 
 *     component </li> 
 * </ul>
 * Basic exmple: </p> 
 * 
 * <p> 
 * <pre>
 *      
 *      
 *      FilieSession session = filingManager.getFileSession();
 *      if (session.canReadFile()) {
 *          DataInputStream dis = session.getInputStream();
 *      }
 *      
 *              
 *      
 * </pre>
 * </p> 
 * 
 * <p> Or, the session may support direct access to specified files. </p> 
 * 
 * <p> 
 * <pre>
 *      
 *      
 *      FileSession session filingSession.getFileSessionForPath("/etc/osid/config.txt");
 *      
 *              
 *      
 * </pre>
