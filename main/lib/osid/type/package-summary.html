 * 
 * <p>Defines the interfaces necessary to describe the type
 * service.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The type package defines a set of interfaces for managing <code> Type 
 * </code> definitions. <code> Types </code> are used as an identifier 
 * primarily for identification of interface extensions throughout the OSIDs 
 * and occasionally used as an extensible enumeration. An agreement between a 
 * consumer and a provider means they support the same <code> Type. </code> 
 * </p> 
 * 
 * <p> A <code> Type </code> is similar to an Id but includes other data for 
 * display and organization. The identification portion of the Type is 
 * globally unique and contains: </p> 
 * 
 * <p> 
 * <ul>
 *     <li> authority: the name of the entity or organization responsible for 
 *     the type. Using a domain name is a reasonable convention. </li> 
 *     <li> identifier: a string serving as an id. The identifier may be a 
 *     urn, guid, oid or some other means of identification. Since all of the 
 *     identification elements including the domain and authority create an 
 *     overall unique Type, the identifier may even be a sequence number 
 *     defined within a particular domain. </li> 
 *     <li> namespace: a string identifying the namespace of the identifier, 
 *     such as "urn" or "oid". </li> 
 * </ul>
 * Lookup example: </p> 
 * 
 * <p> 
 * <pre>
 *      
 *      
 *      Type type = lookupSession.getType("asset", "uri",         
 *                                        "http://harvestroad.com/osidTypes/image",
 *                                        "harvestroad.com");
 *      print type.getDisplayName();
 *      
 *              
 *      
 * </pre>
 * </p> 
 * 
 * <p> The sessions in this OSID offer the capabilities of a <code> Type 
 * </code> registry to centrally manage definitions and localized display 
 * strings and descriptions. Applications may opt to construct their own 
 * <code> Types </code> directly and bypass this service. Types are part of an 
 * internal hierarchy. The type hierarchy generally parallels the interface 
 * hierarchy in an OSID object. For example, an Asset may offer an interface 
 * extension for a jpeg image whose definition extends a more generic image 
 * interface. The type hierarchy may look like assetType -> assetImageType -> 
 * assetJPEGType. Note that the root of the hierarchy is the core object 
 * interface. Since the types are part of a specification in itself, the Type 
 * contains knowledge if its own hierarchy. </p> 
 * 
 * <p> It is possible to bypass the Type OSID entirely and simply construct 
 * the type classes directly. This has the feature of being expedient and 
 * contains the type definitions with their consuming code. This may get 
 * cumbersome for managing larger numbers of types especially when they come 
 * in the form of hierarchies. Unless an application will display a type, it 
 * can simply construct a type based on the identification components and not 
 * use this service. OSID implementations benefit more by using this service 
 * since the type hierarchy is necessary in order to respond to 
 * interoperability tests and it, provides a place to perform mappings across 
 * different type definitions, and provides displayable metadata to its 
 * consumers. </p> 
 * 
 * <p> Most OSID interfaces are used to encapsulate implementation-specific 
 * objects from provider to consumer. The <code> Type </code> interface is 
 * bi-directional and as such cannot be used to encapsulate 
 * implementation-specific data other than what is defined explicitly in the 
 * <code> Type. </code> A provider must respect any <code> Type </code> based 
 * on its interface alone. </p>
