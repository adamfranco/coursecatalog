 * <center><strong>osid 3.0.0</strong></center>
 * 
 * <p>Defines the interfaces necessary to describe the osid
 * service.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The <code> osid </code> package defines how an application loads a 
 * service and includes common definitions used throughout the OSIDs. The 
 * <code> osid </code> package consists of: </p> 
 * 
 * <p> 
 * <ul>
 *     <li> <code> OsidProfile: </code> The <code> OsidProfile </code> defines 
 *     the interoperability tests for an OSID. </li> 
 *     <li> <code> OsidRuntimeManager </code> : The <code> OsidRuntimeManager 
 *     </code> defines an interface to instantiate and initialize an instance 
 *     of an OSID implementation. </li> 
 *     <li> <code> OsidManager </code> : The <code> OsidManager </code> 
 *     defines an interface for methods in common throuhgout the various OSID 
 *     managers. An OSID manager is the principal control point that profiles 
 *     supported services and types, and is responsible for session creation. 
 *     OSID managers are created through the <code> OsidRuntimeEnvironment. 
 *     </code> </li> 
 *     <li> <code> OsidProxyManager: </code> A variant of an <code> 
 *     OsidManager </code> for methods that support proxy authentication 
 *     objects. </li> 
 *     <li> <code> OsidSession </code> : The <code> OsidSession </code> 
 *     defines an interface for methods in common throughout the various OSID 
 *     sessions. An OSID session contains method definitions for an aspect of 
 *     a service. OSID sessions are created through OSID managers. </li> 
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <ul>
 *     <li> <code> OsidObject: </code> The <code> OsidObject </code> defines 
 *     an interface for methods in common throughout the various OSID objects. 
 *     An OSID object defines a set of object data. OSID objects are accessed 
 *     from OSID sessions. </li> 
 *     <li> <code> OsidQuery: </code> The <code> OsidQuery </code> defines an 
 *     interface in common throughout the various OSID queries. An <code> 
 *     OsidQuery </code> defines a set of methods to query an OSID for its 
 *     <code> OsidObjects. </code> </li> 
 *     <li> <code> OsidSearch: </code> The <code> OsidSearch </code> defines 
 *     an interface in common throughout vrious OSID searches. An <code> 
 *     OsidSearch </code> defines a set of methods to manage search options 
 *     for performing searches. </li> 
 *     <li> <code> OsidSearch: </code> The <code> OsidSearch </code> defines 
 *     an interface in common throughout vrious OSID searches. <code> 
 *     OsidSearchResults </code> defines a set of methods to manage search 
 *     results. </li> 
 *     <li> <code> OsidForm: </code> The <code> OsidForm </code> defines an 
 *     interface for methods in common throughout the various OSID forms. An 
 *     OSID form defines a set of methods to modify data in an OSID object. 
 *     OSID forms are accessed from OSID sessions. </li> 
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <ul>
 *     <li> <code> OsidReceiver: </code> The <code> OsidReceiver </code> 
 *     defines an interface in common throughout the OSID receivers. An <code> 
 *     OsidReceiver </code> defines a set of methods invoked for asynchronous 
 *     notification. </li> 
 *     <li> <code> OsidList: </code> The OsidList defines an interface for 
 *     methods in common throughout the various lists. An <code> OsidList 
 *     </code> defines a set of methods to sequentially access a set of 
 *     objects. OSID lists are accessed from OSID sessions. </li> 
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <ul>
 *     <li> <code> OSID: </code> enumerates the list of supported OSIDs </li> 
 *     <li> <code> Metadata: </code> defines a set of methods for describing a 
 *     data element to provide application hints for the <code> creation 
 *     </code> and updating of the data element </li> 
 *     <li> Primitive: enumerates the list of supported primitive types for 
 *     describing metadata </li> 
 *     <li> <code> TimeResolution: </code> enumerates a list of tiem 
 *     resolutions for use with metadata in date/time data elements </li> 
 *     <li> <code> Property: </code> Maps a name to a value. Properties are 
 *     available in OSID objects to provide a simplified view of data that may 
 *     exist within a typed interface. </li> 
 *     <li> <code> PropertyList: </code> A list of properties. </li> 
 * </ul>
 * Generally, these definitions are not accesed directly but are used to 
 * define interfaces in the OSIDs themselves. OSIDs derive most of their 
 * definitions from a definition in the osid package. What methods appear in 
 * the interfaces at this level versus an actual OSID is determined by the 
 * typing in the method signatures. The osid package interfaces are a means of 
 * ensuring consistency of common methods and not designed to facilitate 
 * object polymorphism among different OSIDs. A language binder may elect to 
 * alter the interface hierarchy presented in this specification and a 
 * provider need not parallel these interfaces in their implementations. </p> 
 * 
 * <p> The flow of control through any OSID can be described in terms of these 
 * definitions. An <code> OsidManager </code> or <code> OsidProxyManager 
 * </code> is retrieved from the <code> OsidRuntimeManager </code> for a given 
 * service. Both types of managers share an interface for describing what they 
 * support in the <code> OsidProfile. </code> <code> OsidSessions </code> are 
 * created from the <code> OsidManager. </code> OsidSessions tend to be 
 * organized along clusters of like-functionality. Lookup-oriented sessions 
 * retrieve <code> OsidObjects. </code> Return of multiple <code> OsidObjects 
 * </code> is done via the <code> OsidList. </code> Search-oriented sessions 
 * retrieve <code> OsidObjects </code> through searches provided through the 
 * <code> OsidQuery </code> and <code> OsidSearch </code> interfaces. </p> 
 * 
 * <p> Administrative-oriented sessions create and update <code> OsidObjects 
 * </code> using the <code> OsidForm </code> interface. The <code> OsidForm 
 * </code> makes available Metadata to help define its rules for setting and 
 * changing various data elements. </p> 
 * 
 * <p> A notification session provides a means for subscribing to events, "a 
 * new object has been created", for example, and these events are received 
 * from an <code> OsidReceiver. </code> </p>
