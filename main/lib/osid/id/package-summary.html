/**
 * <center><strong>id 3.0.0</strong></center>
 * 
 * <p>Defines the interfaces necessary to describe the id
 * service.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The Id OSID provides the means for creating and mapping identifiers. All 
 * OSID objects are identified by a unique and immutable <code> Id. </code> 
 * The <code> Id </code> OSID can be used to generate new <code> Ids </code> 
 * when creating new obje_ts. </p> 
 * 
 * <p> Consumers wishing to persist an OSID object should instead persist the 
 * reference to the object by serializing the <code> Id. </code> </p> 
 * 
 * <p> <code> </code> Most OSID interfaces are used to encapsulate 
 * implementation-specific objects from provider to consumer. The <code> Id 
 * </code> interface is bi-directional and as such cannot be used to 
 * encapsulate implementation-specific data other than what is defined 
 * explicitly in the <code> Id. </code> A provider must respect any <code> Id 
 * </code> based on its interface alone. </p> 
 * 
 * <p> The <code> Id </code> service can also be used as a means to map one 
 * identifier to another when an object is known by multiple identifiers. 
 * Mapping identifier spaces is often a critical part of interoperability and 
 * the Id service can be used as a shim to bridge different systems. </p> 
 * 
 * <p> Id mapping example: 
 * <pre>
 *      
 *      
 *      public Asset getAsset(assetId) {
 *          Id id = idSession.getId(assetId);
 *          return (other_impl.getAsset(assetId));
 *      }
 *      
 *              
 *      
 * </pre>
