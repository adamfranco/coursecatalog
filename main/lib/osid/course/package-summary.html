 * <p>Defines the interfaces necessary to describe the course
 * service.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The Course OSID provides course management services for educational 
 * offerings or other gatherings related to an event or curriculum. Courses 
 * may be used to model a class, conference session, or even a meetup group. 
 * </p> 
 * 
 * <p> The Course OSID defines two course interfaces. A <code> CourseOffering 
 * </code> describes a scheduled course. Courses may be stored in a 
 * "canonical" form for reusability among multiple <code> CourseOfferings 
 * </code> using the <code> Course </code> interface. Both <code> Courses 
 * </code> and <code> CourseOfferings </code> may be organized into <code> 
 * CourseCatalogs </code> that may reflect a provider, program, term or some 
 * other organizational scheme. A <code> CourseOffering </code> maps a <code> 
 * Course </code> to a <code> Term </code> and location. A <code> Term </code> 
 * is an arbitrary period of time in which <code> CourseOfferings </code> 
 * occur. <code> Terms </code> may also be hierarchical to capture smaller 
 * periods of time within larger periods of time. The location can be 
 * represented as a <code> Resource </code> to normalize a fixed location 
 * identity such as a room. The can also be described as a display string, or 
 * both. </p> 
 * 
 * <p> A <code> CourseOffering </code> may also relate additional resources. A 
 * <code> Calendar </code> can be used to convey multiple meeting times or 
 * other milestones such as exams or due dates pertinent to the course. A 
 * learning objective can be used to relate the <code> CourseOffering </code> 
 * to a stated objective that in turn provides relationships to assessments 
 * and other course ofefrings an materials. The <code> CourseOffering </code> 
 * may also include a URL to identify an external course web site or learning 
 * management system. </p> 
 * 
 * <p> [enrollment] In addition to the cataloging, <code> Courses </code> and 
 * <code> CourseOfferings </code> may also be mapped to <code> Topics. </code> 
 * A <code> Topic </code> provides a tagging mechanism to allow browsing or 
 * searching by subject matter. <code> Topics </code> may also be hierarchical 
 * and organized into <code> CourseCatalogs. </code> </p> 
 * 
 * <p> The Course OSID at its most basic level provides the means of defining 
 * a course or program catalog. It contains many optional services and 
 * relationships to execute various course management functions. </p>
