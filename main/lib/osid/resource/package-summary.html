 * <p>Defines the interfaces necessary to describe the resource
 * service.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The Resource OSID defines a service to access and manage a directory of 
 * objects. These objects may represent people, places or a set or arbitrary 
 * entities that are used throughout the OSIDs as references to indirect 
 * objects. In the core OSID, resources have no other meaning other than to 
 * provide an identifier and a relation to an authentication principal. 
 * Resource <code> Types </code> may define extra data to define an employee, 
 * organizational unit or an inventory item. </p> 
 * 
 * <p> By itself, the Resource OSID can be used to manage inventories or 
 * directories of objects. Resources may be mapped into hierarchial Bins for 
 * the purpose of cataloging or federation. The Resource OSID in conjunction 
 * with other OSIDs simply provides a consistent interface with which to 
 * access and manage objects. For example, a Repository OSID may define a 
 * Resource OSID that manages authors or a Course OSID may define a Resource 
 * OSID to manage students and instructors. A <code> Resource </code> also 
 * provides the mapping between an authentication <code> Agent </code> and the 
 * entity on whose behalf the agent is acting. An <code> Agent </code> can 
 * only map to a single <code> Resource </code> while a <code> Resource 
 * </code> can have multiple <code> Agents. </code> An agent that represents 
 * the unix login of "vijay" on server due.mit.edu can map to a Resource 
 * representing Vijay Kumar, who may also have a campus agent of 
 * "vkumar@mit.edu". When a <code> Resource </code> is referenced in another 
 * OSID, it is a singular entity. To provide groupings of multiple people or 
 * things, a <code> Resource </code> can also be defined as a group of other 
 * resources. Whether a resource is a single entity or a group is an attribute 
 * of the <code> Resource </code> itself. If a <code> Resource </code> is a 
 * group, then its membership can be queried or managed in one of the group 
 * sessions. This overloading of the object definition serves to keep the 
 * nature of the resource separate from the other OSIDs such that a message to 
 * a "group", for example, is referenced as a single resource receipient. </p>
